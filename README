endianness reports on whether the processor is big- or little-endian.

To install from source:-

    ./configure                     # generate makefiles
    make                            # build
    sudo make install               # install

To install from a git checkout instead of a source tarball, you'll need to run
autotools to generate the configure script, etc:-

    autoreconf --install            # install build system
